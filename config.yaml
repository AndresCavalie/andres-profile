    content: |-
      My name is Andres Cavalie, and I was born in Peru. I moved to Manchester TN at a young age, and as long as I can remember, I have had a fascination with all things computers.
      So of course, I went to school to major in Computer Science. </br></br>While I've been here, I worked as a Doordash driver while I made youtube videos for my real estate business, and I now work at a restaurant called Wooden City.
      I mention my real estate business because I would describe myself as industrious and hardworking, so I always feel the need to do something "extracurricular."</br></br> 
      Now, my "extracurricular" is learning (and doing) as much as I possibly can with regards to software/web development every day, while going to school and working every day of the week, and I truly enjoy it.
      I believe this career choice is perfect for me, because if there's something I love, it's solving problems and overcoming challenges.</br></br>
